# Frontend Session Assignment

For assignment for frontend integration, you are to do the following,

1. Implement the functionality to edit a student by making use of the `update_student` function in the contract.

2. Implement the functionality to delete a student by making use of the `delete_student` function in the contract.
   note: The `delete_student` function doesn't actually delete the student but rather, sets the `is_active` property to false. Also when implementing this functionality, there should be a pop thats asks the user whether they are sure they want to delete the student or not.

3. Update the front page to have a sort dropdown in which a user can sort the students according to: active students, inactive students or all students.
